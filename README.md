Source code of the shiny application available at : http://nathanprovin.shinyapps.io/GeneTissueSpe/ 

Implements the SPM/CTM/Ib scores as well as the Tau index to measure the level of tissue-specific expression of a given list of genes. 
Results are displayed through histograms to show tissue specificity distributions. Raw results tables can be downloaded from the table tabset.
